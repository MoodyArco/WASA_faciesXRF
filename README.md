# WASA-faciesXRF
It is a research project in the framework of Wadden Sea Archive Project (WASA). We collect the XRF profiles and core descriptions of 92 sediment cores from tidal flats, channels, and off-shore around the island of Norderney in order to develop an automatic facies recognition model. It is also an approach to utilize machin learning and data analysis methods (SciPy ecosystem in Python) on the geosciences data. The works are conducted by jupyter notebook and python script. The jupyter notebooks are mainly used for analyzing data and some trials, while the python scripts are the heacy works submitted to the high performance computation in University of Bremen. 

## Why open this project on Github
I'm a PhD student started this development from spring 2019. Our research group is GEOPOLAR, University of Bremen. During this period, some results are achieved. I think it's time to share my workflow and scripts with the open source community because I've been benifited a lot from the community. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. If you're a newby student want to work on large geochemical and sedimentary dataset, you might find something interesting in this project. If you're a experienced data scientist, you might find immature way of analyzing in this project. After all, I'm willing to share my experience to you.

Since it's my first time to open source, there are still many details need to be improved.
